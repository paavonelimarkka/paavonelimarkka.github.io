<p>I was a guest lecturer at JAMK University of applied sciences in two courses. The first course was a part of the Game Programming module and the second course was a course funded by the ELY for adult studends.</p>

<p>I taught the basics of Unity: interface, GameObjects and Assets, scripting, physics and rendering. I also guided the groups with their game project through the course.</p>

<p>While I was teaching the course, I wrote my bachelorâ€™s thesis for JAMK about the subject. You can find the thesis from here: <a href="https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/75534">Teaching Unity3D in Game Programming Module</a></p>

<p>I had my exchange study period in Netherlands @ NHTV International Game Architecture &amp; Design. I studied with first year Indie Game Design class, and we had this Game Lab course which was basically a big game project. We had a team of 8 people and my main responsibility was the level design. The game is made with Unity3D game engine.</p>

<p>The game itself was a pseudo-3D zero gravity space adventure. You are a lonely drone sent to clean up a mess in a forgotten space station, where you are supposed to collect debris, solve physic-based puzzles and avoid danger. The biggest mechanic was the tractor beam, which let you to pull of push objects.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about Unity, SVN and working internationally.</p>

<p>FreeNest is a cloud based open source communal software development platform which includes the most needed tools to communicate, develop and test your projects. <a href="http://freenest.org/home">Freenest.org</a></p>

<p>I was a Junior member of User Experience team, and our main goal was to rebrand the whole product. My main task was to design the new brand and to update the themes of various tools in FreeNest. I also made some promo material, for example: posters, rollup, business cards, coasters etc. I learned some new web development technologies and more about git and scrum.</p>

<p>You can download the new FreeNest brandbook <a href="http://freenest.org/training_portal_material/SharedMaterial/brandbook_2013.pdf">here</a>.</p>
