<p>I was working at Mediataivas as a web developer for a summer. My main task was to create working and responsive themes based on a design and afetrwards putting them on a cms. I learned a lot of new web development techniques and tools.</p>

<p>Few things I learned: css-precompressors (less particulary), Concrete5 content management system and Twitter Bootstrap framework.</p>

<p>Here are some sites I was involved with: PIC1, PIC2, PIC3</p>
