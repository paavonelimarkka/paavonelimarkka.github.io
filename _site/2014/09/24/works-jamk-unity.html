<p>I was a guest lecturer at JAMK University of applied sciences in two courses. The first course was a part of the Game Programming module and the second course was a course funded by the ELY for adult studends.</p>

<p>I taught the basics of Unity: interface, GameObjects and Assets, scripting, physics and rendering. I also guided the groups with their game project through the course.</p>

<p>While I was teaching the course, I wrote my bachelorâ€™s thesis for JAMK about the subject. You can find the thesis from here: <a href="https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/75534">Teaching Unity3D in Game Programming Module</a></p>
