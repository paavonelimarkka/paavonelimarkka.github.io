[Digile N4S](http://www.n4s.fi/en/) is a research program funded by TEKES and we are representing JAMK University of Applied Sciences on the program.

I'm currently working as a product owner and project manager for our reference product called Teamboard. Teamboard is an open source realtime collaboration tool for teams. It can be used to add agile methodologies in the workflow for example using it as a kanban board.

You can try the demo version of the Teamboard [here](http://teamboard.n4sjamk.org) or you can also check our [wiki](https://github.com/N4SJAMK/teamboard-meta/wiki) on the Github.

See what we have done on our website [n4sjamk.github.io](http://n4sjamk.github.io/) or on our [github page](http://github.com/n4sjamk)
