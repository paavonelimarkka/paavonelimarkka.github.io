[Digile N4S](http://www.n4s.fi/en/) is a research program funded by TEKES and we are representing JAMK University of Applied Sciences on the program.

I'm currently working as a product owner and project manager for our reference product called Contriboard. Contriboard is an open source realtime brainstorm service.

Visit the Contriboard website [here](http://teamboard.n4sjamk.org) or check our [wiki](https://github.com/N4SJAMK/teamboard-meta/wiki) on the Github.

See what else we have done from our website [n4sjamk.github.io](http://n4sjamk.github.io/) or on our [github page](http://github.com/n4sjamk)

I have learned a lot about project management, lean and agile workflows and frameworks, software-as-a-service development, feedback channels etc. I also did some web development, for example the Contriboard [webiste](https://n4sjamk.github.io/contriboard)
