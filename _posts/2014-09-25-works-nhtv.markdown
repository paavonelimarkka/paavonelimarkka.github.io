title: NHTV Breda, Z-Gee game project
tag: work
---

I had my exchange study period in Breda, Netherlands. I was studying indie game development in a university called NHTV University of Applied Sciences. There we had this big game project which took half years.

Our game is called Z-Gee. It is a game where you control a lonely drone on an abandoned space station. Your aim is to survive and beat the boss in the last level, going through physic based puzzles and different obstacles. My main responsibility was the level design, but I also got to adjust metrics and design the gameplay itself.

I learned a lot about Unity, SVN and working internationally.
