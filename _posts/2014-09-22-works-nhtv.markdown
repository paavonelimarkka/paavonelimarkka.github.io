I had my exchange study period in Netherlands @ NHTV International Game Architecture & Design. I studied with first year Indie Game Design class, and we had this Game Lab course which was basically a big game project. We had a team of 8 people and my main responsibility was the level design. The game is made with Unity3D game engine.

The game itself was a pseudo-3D zero gravity space adventure. You are a lonely drone sent to clean up a mess in a forgotten space station, where you are supposed to collect debris, solve physic-based puzzles and avoid danger. The biggest mechanic was the tractor beam, which let you to pull of push objects.

I learned a lot about Unity, SVN and working internationally.
