FreeNest is a cloud based open source communal software development platform which includes the most needed tools to communicate, develop and test your projects. [Freenest.org](http://freenest.org/home)

I was a Junior member of User Experience team, and our main goal was to rebrand the whole product. My main task was to design the new brand and to update the themes of various tools in FreeNest. I also made some promo material, for example: posters, rollup, business cards, coasters etc. I learned some new web development technologies and more about git and scrum.

You can download the new FreeNest brandbook [here](http://freenest.org/training_portal_material/SharedMaterial/brandbook_2013.pdf).
